# Movie Recommendation System
By Prerna Kapoor
Introduction
Recommendation systems plays an important role in e-commerce and online streaming services, such as Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, etc. Making the right recommendation for the next product/service, music or movie increases user retention and satisfaction, leading to product/service sales, thus increasing profit growth. Companies competing for customer loyalty invest on recommendation systems that capture and analyze the userâ€™s preferences, and offer products/services with higher likelihood of purchase. In this project, our aim is to develop a movie recommendation system.

Problem Definition
We want to build a movie recommendation system using clustering models. Given a list of movies, we aim to create a new list of movies using clustering models. Because we don't have user-specific information, we have to make recommendations based on content, genre, language, popularity, actors, revenue, cast etc. In order to discover the relationships between movies we will make an exploratory data analysis. We will use our analysis to build and improve our models. For example, some keywords in the description of a movie or genre can be a significant parameter when recommending movies. We will analyse our data to find these sort of relationships between movies.

We have two questions that we want to answer in our work:

How are movies related by their numerical attributes? (e.g. budget, revenue and popularity)
How are movies related by their non-numerical attributes? (e.g. genre,cast,crew)
